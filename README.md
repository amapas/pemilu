# Election JavaScript Code

This JavaScript code simulates an election process (pemilu). It defines a `Candidate` class to represent candidates with properties like name, party, and agenda, and a `VotingBooth` class to manage the voting process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the `election.js` file into your project.
2. Include `election.js` in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag.
3. Run your HTML file in a web browser to see the output in the console.

## Explanation

- The `Candidate` class represents a candidate with properties like name, party, and agenda. It has methods `campaign()` to log information about the candidate's campaign and `addVote()` to add votes to the candidate.
- The `VotingBooth` class manages the voting process. It has methods to add candidates and conduct the election by simulating votes from a voter list.
- Candidate objects are created, added to a voting booth, and a simulated voter list is used to conduct the election.
- The election results are displayed in the console.
